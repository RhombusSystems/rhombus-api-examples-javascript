# Rhombus API Examples Javascript

## What is this
This repo contains demo code samples in NodeJS using Javascript and Typescript that show how to use the [Rhombus API](https://apidocs.rhombussystems.com/reference). 

This repo uses [Rhombus Codegen](https://github.com/RhombusSystems/rhombus-api-examples-codegen) to interface with the API for many of its examples


## Installation
For instructions of how to build and install, refer to the README.md in each of the module directories. You do not have to generate the RhombusTypescriptAPI for each of the examples, you only need to do this step once
